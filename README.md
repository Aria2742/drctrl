# drctrl

This program is an edit of acidjazz's Draconic Reactor control code. I still use his library and most of his code is unchanged, however I did fix some math and make the program more robust. This is what I am currently using for my reactors and so far it has been more accurate. For setup instructions, go to acidjazz's original repository here: https://github.com/acidjazz/drmon

To install the script run the command: "pastebin run cD5w1sa9 install" on the advanced computer in charge of the reactor and reboot it. The script runs automatically on reboot.

You can edit some of the variables in the code at the top, such as the maximum safe temperature, minimum safe field percent, minimum safe fuel percent, and more.
