# drctrl

This program is an edit of acidjazz's Draconic Reactor control code. I still use his library and most of his code is unchanged, however I did fix some math and make the program more robust. This is what I am currently using for my reactors and so far it has been more accurate. For setup instructions, go toacidjazz's original repository here: https://github.com/acidjazz/drmon
